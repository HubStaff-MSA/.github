# Hi there üëã

## Welcome to Our Organization

We are a dynamic team from the German University in Cairo, dedicated to exploring and implementing scalable microservices architectures. Our project is focused on creating a replica of the Hubstaff application, utilizing state-of-the-art technologies to ensure robustness and scalability.

## Contribution Guidelines

üåà **How to Get Involved:**

1. **Team Formation:** Our project is divided into 4 sub-teams, each focusing on different layers of the technology stack.
2. **Work Division:** Each sub-team works vertically through the technology stack to minimize dependencies and ensure smooth progress. This approach allows members to gain comprehensive experience in their area.

üçø **Fun Facts:**

- Our team thrives on collaboration and innovation.
- We believe in balancing work with fun activities; expect some spontaneous team-building events!
